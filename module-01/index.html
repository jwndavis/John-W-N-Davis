    <h2>Floating Sheep Manifesto Reaction</h2>
    I wasn't sure what to think of the title of this essay when it was first presented. I was pleasently surprised by this collaboration of ideas about how we perceive maps and how they represent data in our digital age. The New Jerusalem section was a new and interesting concept. I hadn't before made the connection that we have created our own Mappa Mundi with the technological advances of today's mapping software systems. Throughout the ages, people inherently have their own sense of place and how we identify ourselves with our known area. In the 13th century, Jerusalem was the spiritual center of the known world, where as today, we have become modest by becoming the center of our world and using online mapping applications to cater to our needs. This shows how maps and humans have evolved from explorers searching for new worlds to consumers of spatial information in our world that grows smaller and smaller.
