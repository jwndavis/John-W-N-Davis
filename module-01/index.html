<h1>Module 01 Reading Assignment</h1>
    <h2>Floating Sheep Manifesto Reaction</h2>
    <p><p style="margin-left: 40px">I wasn't sure what to think of the title of this essay when it was first presented. From the first paragraph and witty side commentary,<br>
    I knew this wasn't your typical essay. This collaboration of ideas about how we perceive maps and how they represent data in our digital<br>
    age compared to the cartographers of old was certainly an intriguing read. The New Jerusalem section was a new and interesting concept.<br>
    I hadn't before made the connection that we have created our own Mappa Mundi with the technological advances of today's mapping software<br>
    systems. Throughout the ages, people inherently have their own sense of place and how we identify ourselves with our known area. In the<br>
    13th century, Jerusalem was the spiritual center of the known world, where as today, we have become modest by becoming the center of our<br>
    world and using online mapping applications to cater to our needs. This shows how maps and humans have evolved from explorers searching<br>
    for new worlds to consumers of spatial information in our world that grows smaller and smaller.</p><br>
    
    <p><p style="margin-left: 40px">The most problematic Floating Sheep Manifesto point for me as a cartographer is probably #2a. and #2b. All maps lie, but those lies are<br>
    necessary. Map projections are the prime example. Choosing a map projection to display your data for maximum comprehension, is a conundrum<br>
    we mappers face all the time. Representing a 3D earth on a 2D surface distorts our area of interest. We must choose the projection that<br>
    creates the least distortion of size and shape of our area. Whichever projection we choose aids us in creating the best map we can.<br>
    Sometimes we compromise and sacrifice perhaps a better projection over one that helps demonstrate a more detailed map based on our<br>
    limitations. Example: A map of the contiguous United States in Web Mercator rather than Albers Equal Area because of certain base map<br>
    information needed for proper functionality.</p><br>
    
    <p><p style="margin-left: 40px">I associate myself with the cartographer. We study the foundations of map making and apply our cartographic principals and reasoning to the<br>
    maps we create and produce. We sometimes obsess over our creation, much like an artist and their work, in order to create 'the perfect map'.<br>
    I find myself constantly nit-picking and editing my layout to create that perfect map based the data I'm trying to display. I always consider<br>
    my audience when creating my map product and take into account who will be viewing this creation. Will everyone seeing this map be able to<br>
    comprehend the spatial data displayed? Have I included or not included the correct elements in order to explain my data in a coherent manner?<br>
    I always try to address these questions when creating a map, whether it has specific requirements for a class, or if I'm experimenting on my<br>
    own for fun. As I continue with my career in mapping, I hope to learn more about how to create compelling maps and also about the new<br>
    technologies and concepts available in order to expand my knowledge about this ever growing subject of digital mapping.</p>
